## Tips
- When using Github, be sure to clone the repo from Github using the `git clone` command.
- If you don't already have SSH Keys set up for github, I would HIGHLY recomend setting those up. [Click here for Github Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
