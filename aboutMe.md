# About: Aubrey 
Tell me alittle about yourself. Hobbies, intrestes, why you are perusing a degree in web development.
Most importantly tell me your experience with JavaScript and webdevelopment so far.


Hello, my name is Aubrey Jones. I have a lot of fun with creative projects, love to problem solve, and think of the big picture. I find UX/UI design and web development to be just so, which is why I have chosen the field of study. It is also a huge plus that it pays well, and I get to work from home! My professional goal is to be a full stack UX/UI designer and web developer. I have thoughts to continue on with project management. I'll decide that after I complete my degree at Utah Valley University. 

I have a few years worth of experience with JavaScript. I've mostly used it in frameworks. I find I may understand more than I realize, and just need to practice it more often. 

## For front end development, I am very familiar with:  
* HTML5
* CSS3 
* SCSS 
* JSON 
* Bootstrap 
* React

I would love to learn Vue and Angular. I have some experience with backend development as far as Node.JS. I want to learn more about the server side to complete my full stack experience, and have eyes on PHP as well.
